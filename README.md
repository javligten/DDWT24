This assignment is a web application that connects to an SQLite database to manage movies. The user can view the list of movies, add new movies and delete or edit movies from the database. The application uses a registration system, so only users who are logged in can access the movie database. The application also has a 404 error handler for when users are trying to enter a non existent web page from the application.
